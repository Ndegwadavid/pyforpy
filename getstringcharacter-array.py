#the first character in python lang has ussually the position zero
a = 'hello'
print(a[1]) #this will print (e) hence its the following after zero 


#looping through a string
#since strings are arrays we can loop though the characters using the for loop
for x in "banana":
    #print(x)

#to print the length of charcters we will be using the len attribute
a = "Hello world"
print(len(a))

#to check the string in acharcater or a text
a = "The best things in life are free!"
print("free" in a)  #this will return a true value if it gets the value in the string provided
