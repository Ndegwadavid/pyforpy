#the ways to print outputs in python
#method 1
x = 'python is awesome'
print(x)

#method 2
x = 'python'
y = 'is'
z = 'awesome'
print(x,y,z)
#method3 using the plus sign
x = 'python '
y = 'is '
z = 'awesome '
print(x+y+z)

#calculations with python
x = 5
y = 10
print(x + y)

#a string and an int will never meger lest they will lead to errors
x =5
y = 'John'
print(x+y) #this will lead to errors but can be done when separated by a comma 
x=5
y = 'john'
print(x, y) #this code will work
